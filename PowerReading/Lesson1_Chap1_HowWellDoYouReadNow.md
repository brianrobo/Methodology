## Chapter 1 - How Weel Do You Read Now?
* Initial Exam
  - Most people feel that they read well, but they don't know precisely what that means.
  - As with most things, some objective standard is necessary for measurement.
    - Without some measure you would not know how much you actually had improved upon finishing this course.
  - How well you read is based on two factors:
    - speed
    - comprehension.
  - If you read extremely fast, but can't understanding the material,
    then you might as well not have read it.
  - If you read too slowly, you may never have time to finish what you start.
  - Both factors are important.

## Chapter 2 - How Much Can You Expect To Improve?


- Almost everyone recognizes that the success of any decision is based on
  the accuracy and completeness of the data on which the decision is to be made.
  If your data is incomplete, then your understanding of the situation will be
  inadequate, and the success of any consequent decision will also suffer.

- In every field, a prerequisite for success is preparation,
  Without seeking out, collecting, organizing, analyzing and digesting information
  for use, there would be little progress in any area.
  - Science is largely based on the successful utilization of this process.
  - Our modern civilization flows from its application.
  - All businesses, organizations and individuals must do this in order to
    make correct decision and succeed.

- The most successful people in every field need to keep abreast of the latest
  information in order to stay on top of new development and opportunities.
  - This information comes in written form and reading is your key to ist access.

    to do it is based on information. How much you have is largely up to you.

  only at a superficial level.
  - 30~45 sec of exposure can only tell you that a problem exists.
