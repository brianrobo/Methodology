## Q2
- Once you knows what the main idea is, you should ask yourself:

  - Why did you choose it?
  - What is your purpose?
  - What do you hope to get, accomplish or achieve from reading this particular item, book, article,
    piece, paper, magazine or whatever?
- IF answer is nothing, you may not want to read it.
- Strange as it may seem, this realization alone can save many people a great deal of time.

- Too many people feel compelled to finish reading something just because they started it.
- Not knowing what it is about, they start it and then feel uneasy about putting it down unfinished.
  - (me) how stupid..
- Even if they put it down, they feel guilty afterwards.
- There is no reason to be enslaved by such an attitude.
- You should decide how to invest your time in the best manner for yourself
- and not be directly by an absolute rule from some past teacher.
- If you do not wish to read something, that is fine, put it down.

  - For how long?
- Will you be using it in the future?

- What is going to be required of you that is contained in this information?
